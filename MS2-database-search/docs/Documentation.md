# Tandem MS database search using a decoy-based strategy

This documentation describes the various methods implemented in the ms2matcher package. First we will provide a short demonstration on how to use the package and later we will show how the underlying functions work and the intermediate output that they provide.

In addition to this document, the main functions can all be found in the \ms2matcher folder in the main module file ms2matcher.py. All methods are documented according to the  NumPy/SciPy style convention (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt), providing a clear overview of the required inputs and delivered outputs for each method, as well as the design philosephy and inter-dependencies between the methods.

# Brief Overview
This tool implements a simple version of tandem mass spectrometry (MS2 or MS/MS) using a target-decoy database search strategy for the identification of experimentally derived mass spectra of fragmented peptides. For an introduction to tandem MS, please refer to Sadygov, Cociorva & Yates (2004), for a primer on decoy databases, see KÃ¤ll et al. (2008), and for other topics please refer to the reference list at the end of this document.

# Using the software

The package can be run via the command line by calling 'python main.py' followed by the absolute path to a folder containing the experimental spectrum .dta files and optionally the MS1 ( '-t1 --toleranceMS1' ) and MS2 mass tolerance ( '-t2 --toleranceMS2' ). The default values are 50 ppm and 0.1 Dalton respectively.

<pre>
python main.py path/to/spectraFolder -t1 50 -t2 01
</pre>

Running 'python main.py --help' also provides an overview of the accepted arguments.

## Dependencies

This tool relies on the following packages:

- numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)
- pandas (http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- biopython (http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page)
- pyteomics (https://pythonhosted.org/pyteomics/)

Please refer to the packages' manuals, pip (https://docs.python.org/3.6/installing/index.html) or a package management system such as Conda (http://conda.pydata.org/docs/) for more information on how to install additional python packages.

# Step-by-step walkthrough

## Importing protein and peptide databases (in .fasta format)

First the package will read in the protein, peptide digests and reverse decoy databases which are located in the /data/database/ folder of the package. The following lines of code simply show how the relative paths are defined.


```python
import os,sys
import inspect
currentdir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(inspect.getfile(inspect.currentframe())))
parentdir = os.path.dirname(currentdir)
moduledir = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(parentdir, 'ms2matcher'))
sys.path.insert(0,moduledir)
import ms2matcher as ms

data_path = 'data'
database_path = 'database'
spectra_path = 'spectra'
proteinDatabasePath = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(parentdir, data_path,database_path,'studentP.fasta'))
peptideDatabasePath = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(parentdir, data_path,database_path,'studentP_peptides.fasta'))
decoyDatabasePath = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(parentdir, data_path,database_path,'studentD.fasta'))
decoyPeptideDatabasePath = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(parentdir, data_path,database_path,'studentD_peptides.fasta'))
spectraFilePath = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(parentdir,data_path,spectra_path))
```

The .fasta databases are imported into a pandas dataframes. One column contains the sequences of the peptides/proteins, while the other contains either the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot identifiers (for the proteins) or the **monoisotopic masses (M)** (for the peptides).


```python
proteinData = ms.importProteins(proteinDatabasePath)
peptideData = ms.importPeptides(peptideDatabasePath)
decoyPeptideData = ms.importPeptides(decoyPeptideDatabasePath)
decoyData = ms.importProteins(decoyDatabasePath)
```


```python
from IPython.display import display
display(peptideData[:5])
```

## Importing experimental spectra (.dta)

Experimental spectra are imported into numpy arrays. Normally, the path to the file is specified when the tool is run via the command line, but for demonstration purposes the underlying function is shown here.

The .dta file is a tab-deliminated file where the first line contains the precursor m/z value (in (M+H)^+1 format) and the charge, and all the following lines contain **m/z values and intensities**.


```python
expSpec = ms.importExperimentalSpectrum(os.path.normpath(os.path.join(spectraFilePath,'hela1ugul.2404.2404.2.dta')))
print(expSpec[:10])
```


    array([[  2.10287407e+03,   2.00000000e+00],
           [  1.47075820e+02,   1.32865000e+04],
           [  1.56076000e+02,   2.53626000e+03],

           [  1.68064500e+02,   4.42759000e+03],
           [  1.72071260e+02,   1.04343000e+04],
           [  1.75070980e+02,   3.96961000e+04],
           [  1.75118410e+02,   8.27672000e+04]])

For easy retrieval later on the information regarding the precursor ion and the fragmentation peaks are separated.

Note that the **precursor mass** in the .dta file is the charged parent ion (i.e. (M+H)+1 ) monoisotopic mass. We subtract the mass of one proton (1.0072764) to obtain the **uncharged monoisotopic parent mass (M)** from this, because this is the same format the peptide database has.


```python
precursorMass = ms.getPrecursorMass(expSpec)
precursorCharge = ms.getPrecursorCharge(expSpec) if ms.getPrecursorCharge(expSpec)==1 else ms.getPrecursorCharge(expSpec)-1
expMZ = ms.getExperimentalMZs(expSpec)
print(precursorMass)
print(precursorCharge)
```

## Peptide candidates - mass filter

The peptide database is filtered for potential **peptide candidates** based on the monoisotopic mass of the experimental parent peptide. This step is done to reduce the search space to a more manageable size.

The default **mass tolerance** is 50 ppm, but this can be specified in the command line using the argument -t1. 

For example, for the given spectrum, the theoretical peptides can deviate, in either direction, with a value of: $$\frac{\text{Precursor Mass}\times 50}{10^6} = \frac{2101.8667936\times50}{10^6} = 0.10509333968$$


```python
print(precursorMass*50/1000000)
```

    0.10509333968
    

This results in the following peptide candidates in the database: these are all the sequences that fall inside an 0.10 window of the parent monoisotopic mass (M).


```python
peptideCands = ms.peptideCandidates(precursorMass,peptideDatabase=peptideData,massAccuracy=50)
print(peptideCands)
```

## Peptide candidates - fragmenting into b and y ions

For each of the candidate peptides in the filtered pandas DataFrame, the b and y ions are generated and the **monoisotopic m/z values** are calculated for the specified charge (default value is precursor charge minus 1, or 1 for those with charge 1). The resulting masses are stored in separate numpy arrays for the b and y ions, and in the end both are combined into a dictionary.


```python
seq = 'AVDWWGLGVVMYEMMCGR'
print('y ions',[seq[i:] for i in range(len(seq))])
print('b ions:',[seq[:i+1] for i in range(len(seq))])

print(ms.getAllFragmentsChargeX(sequence='AVDWWGLGVVMYEMMCGR',charge=precursorCharge))
```

## Experimental peak matching

**For each experimental m/z value**, the **theoretical fragment masses** are queried to find a corresponding mass. The matching tolerance defaults to 0.1 Dalton, but can be specified in the command line using the parameter -t2.

If a matching value is found, in either the b or y ion array, the score is incremented by 1. A match in both the y and b ions would still only count as an increment of 1, although we do not expect this to occurr often, since the ion residu masses would have to differ by exactly 18 Da. 

After counting all the peaks, this sum is then divided by the total number of experimental peaks.

This procedure is then performed for **every candidate peptide** and the scores are appended to the pandas DataFrame. Note that duplicates are removed in case the peptide database is not unique.


```python
peptideCands = ms.matchExpSpectrumToCandidatePeptides(expMZ,peptideCands,charge=precursorCharge,ms2tolerance=0.1)
print(peptideCands)
```

          Monoisotopic Mass                   Sequence     Score
    1645          2101.9246         AVDWWGLGVVMYEMMCGR  0.024658
    1657          2101.8744  SSGNSSSSGSGSGSTSAGSSSPGAR  0.112329
    1812          2101.8456        GDDEEGECSIDYVEMAVNK  0.013699
    2192          2101.9341        DFNGSDASTQLNTHYAFSK  0.016438
    

### Motivation for using the percentage count as a score

Note that we are matching experimental to theoretical fragments here. We divided the number of matches by the total number of experimental peaks, as opposed to those in the theoretical spectrum. Our motivation for this is the following:

- Our main point of interest is the observed experimental spectrum. We aim to explain this data as good as possible. Any peak that can be found in the theoretical database is a peak that can be explained. 
- The reverse, checking how many of the theoretical peaks are actually observed, is of less importances in our opinion. Indeed, there could be many reasons why a certain theoretically predicted y or b ion might not be observed, e.g. incomplete fragmentation leads to missing ions. But this does not mean that the experimental spectrum did not originate from the peptide in question.
- By dividing by the number of expected theoretical peaks, we are penalizing observed spectra where for example the shortest or longest ions were not observed, but this should not be indicative of a worse match.
- The opposite does not hold either: a theoretical spectrum with only a few peaks might obtain a high score, if almost all of these can be matched to the theoretical spectrum. However, all the other true peaks in the theoretical spectrum cannot be explained by the theoretical one, yet we are not penalizing the score if we divide by the number of theoretical peaks. This peptide would obtain the same score as a peptide which matches additional theoretical peaks, or a lower score than a peptide which matches additional ones, but also lacks a few.
- Any electrical noise or chemical noise (contamination) in the experimental spectrum might result in erroneous matches, but we are working under the assumption that the signal of the peptide that was selected during MS1 will be stronger than the noise.
- Finally, if we would not use the percentage as a score, but rather the raw counts, the score would become less suitable for comparison across spectra, since short peptides would always result in lower scores. 

### Shortcomings
We do note that there are a few shortcomings to this method, which are addressed in other scoring functions such as the X!Tandem cross correlation score.

### A note about isotopic peaks

Our score does not take into account isotopic peaks in the theoretical spectrum, but we believe this is likely not a big issue:

- First of all, all theoretical spectra consist of only the monoisotopic m/z values.
- Consequently, all peptide candidates will fail to match to the higher mass isotopic peaks in the theoretical fragment (unless a different y/b ion has the same m/z as a higher order isotopic peak of a different ion). The scores of the peptides will systematically be lower by the same amount, i.e. their ranking will be consistent.

An alternative strategy would be to first de-isotope the experimental spectrum, but this would require accuracte calling of true peaks and can be difficult if there is noise or overlap between the b/y ion series.

### Visualisation of peak matching
Visually, the following is happening: all black peaks (experimental peaks) that overlap (given a certain error tolerance) with the red peaks (theoretical fragment masses) are counted.


```python
%matplotlib inline
import numpy as np
import pylab
pylab.figure()
pylab.title('Theoretical and experimental spectra')
pylab.xlabel('m/z, Th')
pylab.ylabel('Intensity, rel. units')
pylab.bar(expSpec[:,0], expSpec[:,1], width=0.1, linewidth=2,edgecolor='black')
theor_spectrum = list(ms.getAllFragmentsChargeX(peptideCands.loc[1645,'Sequence'],1).values())
theor_spectrum = np.vstack(theor_spectrum).flatten()
pylab.bar(theor_spectrum,[expSpec[:,1].max()]*len(theor_spectrum),width=0.1, edgecolor='red', alpha=0.7)
```

## Decoy peak matching

The **reversed decoy peptides** are filtered and the *in silico* y/b ions are derived in exactly the same manner as above.


```python
decoyCands = ms.peptideCandidates(precursorMass,peptideDatabase=decoyPeptideData,massAccuracy=50)
decoyCands = ms.matchExpSpectrumToCandidatePeptides(expMZ,decoyCands,charge=precursorCharge,ms2tolerance=0.1)
print(decoyCands)
```

          Monoisotopic Mass             Sequence     Score
    1660          2101.9246   GCMMEYMVVGLGWWDVAR  0.019178
    2146          2101.9341  SFAYHTNLQTSADSGNFDK  0.013699
    

## Peptide Spectrum Match

For each spectrum, the top scoring peptide is selected as the **peptide spectrum match** (or PSM). Doing this for both the target and decoy database results in a target and decoy PSM as follows:


```python
targetPSM = peptideCands.loc[peptideCands['Score'].idxmax()].copy()
targetPSM['Type'] = 'Target'
targetPSM['Spectrum'] = 'hela1ugul.2404.2404.2.dta'
targetPSM = targetPSM.drop('Monoisotopic Mass')

decoyPSM =decoyCands.loc[decoyCands['Score'].idxmax()].copy()
decoyPSM['Type'] = 'Decoy'
decoyPSM['Spectrum'] = 'hela1ugul.2404.2404.2.dta'
decoyPSM = decoyPSM.drop('Monoisotopic Mass')

print(targetPSM,'\n')
print(decoyPSM)
```

## Retrieving peptide spectrum matches for all the spectra

The following functions perform all of the procedures we described above, for all the specified spectra. When running this tool in the command line, all the .dta files in the specified folder will be considered.

All the intermediate steps (i.e. peptide scoring within a spectrum) are printed here for illustration purposes. The final dataframe at the bottom contains the **top target and decoy PSM's for each spectrum**.

## Some notes about target-decoy search strategy

For each experimental spectrum we selected the highest scoring theoretical spectrum as the best match (PSM), but in reality not all of these will be correct matches. Some of the experimental spectra might not be derived from peptide digests of the original protein, but instead stem from contaminating (bio)-molecules. In addition, the correct peptide sequence might not be present in the database or the experimental spectrum might be of poor quality (Elias & Gygi, 2007). 

Because of these issues we need a statistically sound method of calling a match significant. Furthermore, when processing multiple spectra, we should guard ourselves against multiple testing issue, for example by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) (although P-value or Expectation value based approaches also exist

The peptide decoy dataset provides an intuitive representation of the **null hypothesis**: any experimental spectrum that is queried against the decoys will result in decoy matches which are by definition incorrect (Elias & Gygi, 2007; KÃ¤ll et al., 2008). Decoys can be obtained by reversing the original target databases, like was done here, but also by shuffling or stochastically (e.g. using Markov models), and while there is no clear choice for this, the methods generally perform similarly (Jeong, Kim & Bandeira, 2012).

### P-value calculation
The decoy search allows us to calculate p-values by counting how many decoy PSM scores are greater than each target PSM score (KÃ¤ll et al., 2008). However, note that, similar to Monte Carlo p-values, the accuracy depends on the size of the decoy database. In our case the p-values will only be able to take on five different values, but they are still illustrative.


```python
PSM.loc[:,'P-value'] = PSM.apply(lambda row: (row['Score'] <= PSM.loc[PSM['Type'] == 'Decoy','Score']).sum() / PSM.loc[PSM['Type'] == 'Decoy','Score'].size ,axis=1)
print(PSM)

### Multiple testing and false discovery

The decoy search also provides an elegant way to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) and guard against multiple testing issues. The FDR describes the expected number of false positives among all significant/accepted PSM's. By setting a scoring or p-value threshold, the FDR is simply the number of decoys PSM's higher than this threshold, divided by the number of target PSM's (KÃ¤ll et al., 2008): $$ FDR_{t} = \frac{N_{decoy}}{N_{target}} $$ 

where $N_{decoy}$ and $N_{target}$ are the number of PSM scores larger than the threshold $t$.


Note that the top three scores/p-values are all target PSM's, but the fourth is already a high scoring decoy PSM.

### Concatenated versus separate decoy search

We have performed a separate search against the decoy and target database, but it has been suggested that it is more sensible to perform a concatenated search for the purposes of FDR estimation. In this setting decoy and target PSM scores for the same spectrum are competing directly with each other, which avoids too conservative FDR estimation (Elias & Gygi, 2007; Jeong, Kim & Bandeira, 2012). On the other hand, in our simple setting this would have reduced the number of PSM's to five instead of ten, which would have made inference even more difficult.

This is a recommendation to repeat the search, using identical search parameters, against a database in which the sequences have been reversed or randomised. You do not expect to get any true matches from the "decoy" database. So, the number of matches that are found is an excellent estimate of the number of false positives that are present in the results from the real or "target" database

Unfiltered sets of peptide identifications produced in this manner are necessarily imperfect for three reasons: (1) not all peptide species in a sample are represented in the search space; (2) spectra derived from background nonpeptide species will often be given a peptide assignment; and (3) incorrect candidate peptide sequences occasionally may outscore correct sequences. For many search engines, nearly all input MS/MS spectra will be assigned a peptide match if there are any that lie within the supplied mass tolerance. Thus, the primary task of proteomics researchers is to distinguish incorrect from correct peptide assignments.

concatenated database decoy search is better
Once a target-decoy sequence list has been generated, the analysis of a set of MS/MS spectra can begin. The generally accepted means to do this is to supply the search engine with a single protein sequence list consisting of both target and decoy sequences. For each spectrum, the search engine must then choose between target and decoy sequences. Correctly-identified peptides will exclusively be selected from target protein sequences, while incorrect peptide matches will be randomly drawn from target and decoy sequences. If the number of target and decoy sequences considered by the search engine are equal, there should be a one-to-one correlation between target and decoy sequences among incorrect identifications. If the number of target and decoy sequences are unequal, the correlation between target and decoy sequences should reflect this bias. It should be noted that some groups advocate searching target sequences separately from decoy sequences. For a variety of reasons, this procedure can lead to an overly conservative interpretation of search results (14) (see Note 3).



 There are many properties in MS/MS spectrum which provide useful information for identification. Peak height intensity, intensity distribution,  presence of both b & y ion pair are examples.

 Concatenated database searches are preferable to separate
searches
Several research groups have adopted a target-decoy strategy simi-
lar to its first description 4 in which decoy sequences are searched
separately in order to assess score distributions obtained from appar-
ently random matches 9â12 . Ostensibly, this strategy seems reason-
able: if decoy sequences are incorrect, they should behave identically
whether they are considered with target sequences or by themselves.
However, when MS/MS spectra are searched in this way, target and
decoy sequences cannot compete for the top-ranked score in a single
search. Without competition, decoy sequences that partially match
to high-quality MS/MS spectra may often receive elevated scores rel-
ative to other top-ranked hits from the search, suggesting high filter-
ing thresholds need to be applied (Supplementary Fig. 3 online).
Another option is to search MS/MS spectra once against a single
database consisting of target and decoy sequences. Besides decreas-
ing search times by 20â30% relative to two separate searches (data
not shown), target and decoy sequences directly compete for the
algorithm-assigned top rank for a given MS/MS spectrum. Under
these circumstances, target and decoy sequences can usually be easily
distinguished despite a relatively high decoy score (Supplementary
Fig. 3). Because relatively high-scoring decoy sequences rarely out-
score correct identifications in the composite database scenario 1 ,
researchers will not be misled to set inappropriately high scoring
criteria.

Clearly, the greater the number of peptides being matched to any one protein and the greater the sequence coverage, the greater the probability of a correct identification. http://www.mcponline.org/content/3/1/1.full




(Sadygov, Cociorva & Yates, 2004)  The distribution of intensities between b- and y-ions is
the subject of intensive studies, and this distribution can vary by
type of instrument (for example, ion trap as compared to Q-TOF),
but this information is not yet fully exploited in most matching
