# UH-stat-bioinf
A collection of some of the assignments and projects I made during my master program in statistical bioinformatics. 

Purpose
--------
I created this repository to gather (some of) the assignments and projects I made for my master studies. It contains a wide variety of topics related to different courses, mostly related to statistics and bioinformatics. My goals throughout this venture were multifold. First, it gave me the chance to familiarise myself with the git version control system to efficiently track updates and share my results. Next, I intended to try out several tools used in data sciences: R, Python (and the SciPy package), and dynamic report methods (Knitr, Jupyter notebooks, etc.).
