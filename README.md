# UH-stat-bioinf
A collection of some of the notes and assignments I made during my master program in statistical bioinformatics. 

Purpose
--------
I created this repository to gather (some of) the assignments and projects I made for my master studies, as well as some notes I made to reinforce the new concepts I encountered. It contains a wide variety of topics related to different courses, mostly related to statistics and bioinformatics. Some are bare bones analyses, others contain a step-by-step description of my methods, objectives and interpretation. 

My aims throughout this venture were multifold. First, it gave me the chance to familiarise myself with the git version control system to efficiently track updates and share my results. Next, I intended to try out several tools used in data sciences: R, Python (and the SciPy package), and dynamic report methods (Knitr, Jupyter notebooks, etc.).
